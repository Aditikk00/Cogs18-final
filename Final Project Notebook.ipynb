    "COVID-19 has had major impacts on our mental health. I decided to create a chatbot for my final COGS18 project which would act as a 'pre-appointment' survey. Essentially, it asks mental health related questions (based partially on the Kesseler Psychological Test K6 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3370145/) and collects the response from participants. The responses are then added to a DataFrame which a psychologist/therapist could quickly review before meeting their patient. This would help make things much more efficient and allow the counsellor to gauge the patient and tune their meeting accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The survey is targeted towards students and asks questions about their year and whether they live on campus or in another timezone as these are additional factors that impact mental health during COVID-19. The database is not visible to the participants (for privacy reasons) however is visible in this notebook for presentation purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Note:__\n",
    "If user answers 0 = 'None of the time' for all of the Kesseler Questions, further questions are not required so the chatbot will end earlier and store 'None' for the remaining questions in the database. If you want to test a full run through, don't enter 0 for all the questions. If you want to test whether the chatbot ends earlier like it's supposed to, enter 0 for all the questions.\n",
