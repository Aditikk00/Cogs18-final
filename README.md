# MentalHealthChatbot-COVID19
Cogs18 Final Project (Covid mental health chatbot + DataFrame)

COVID-19 has had major impacts on our mental health. I decided to create a chatbot for my final COGS18 project which would act as a 'pre-appointment' survey. 
Essentially, it asks mental health related questions (based partially on the Kesseler Psychological Test K6 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3370145/) and 
collects the response from participants. The responses are then added to a DataFrame which a psychologist/therapist could quickly review before meeting their patient. 
This would help make things much more efficient and allow the counsellor to gauge the patient and tune their meeting accordingly.
